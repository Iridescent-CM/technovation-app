      a third-party screening service, to conduct our background checks.

      <% if current_scope == "mentor" %>
        We complete these checks for mentors as a safety measure before
        they are able to match with a Technovation team.
      <% elsif current_scope == "chapter_ambassador" || current_scope == "club_ambassador" %>
        We complete these checks for <%= current_scope.split("_").first.capitalize %> Ambassadors before they are granted
        access to the students’ data such as names and email addresses.

    <p class="mb-4">
      After you click the “Request background check invitation” button, you will
      receive an email invitation from Checkr with a link to their site. You will
      be prompted on the Checkr site to provide the information required by your
      country in order to perform a criminal background check. After submitting your
      information, you can visit the
      <%= link_to "Checkr Applicant Portal",
        "//applicant.checkr_api_client.com",
        target: "_blank", class: "tw-link" %>
      to review the status of your check. Some checks may take up to 7-10 business days to complete.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will receive an email from us when your background check clears. Once your
      background check has cleared,
      <% if current_scope == "mentor" %>
        you will be able to match with an existing Technovation team or create a new team.
      <% elsif current_scope == "chapter_ambassador" || current_scope == "club_ambassador" %>
        and you have completed the other onboarding steps, you will be able to access the administrative
        information for your chapter.
