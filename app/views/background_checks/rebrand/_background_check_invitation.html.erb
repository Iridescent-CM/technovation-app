        a third-party screening service, to conduct our background checks.

        <% if current_scope == "mentor" %>
          We complete these checks for mentors as a safety measure before
          they are able to match with a Technovation team.
        <% elsif current_scope == "chapter_ambassador" %>
          We complete these checks for Chapter Ambassadors before they are granted
          access to the students’ data such as names and email addresses.

      <p class="mb-4">
        After you click the “Request background check invitation” button, you will
        receive an email invitation from Checkr with a link to their site. You will
        be prompted on the Checkr site to provide the information required by your
        country in order to perform a criminal background check. After submitting your
        information, you can visit the
        <%= link_to "Checkr Applicant Portal",
                    "//applicant.checkr_api_client.com",
                    target: "_blank", class: "tw-link" %>
        to review the status of your check. Some checks may take up to 7-10 business days to complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will receive an email from us when your background check clears. Once your
        background check has cleared,
        <% if current_scope == "mentor" %>
          you will be able to match with an existing Technovation team or create a new team.
        <% elsif current_scope == "chapter_ambassador" %>
          and you have completed the other onboarding steps, you will be able to access the administrative
          information for your chapter.
