      As of August 2, Iridescent, parent organization to the AI Family Challenge and Technovation programs,
      will change its name to Technovation. We’re excited to continue to empower  youth and adults to be leaders,
      creators and problem-solvers through technology.

      We’ve also renamed our programs to clearly connect them to Technovation and address feedback we’ve received
      from amazing partners like you. <strong>The educational focus of each program is not changing</strong>.
