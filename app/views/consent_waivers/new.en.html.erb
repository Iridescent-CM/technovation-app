Volunteer further understands and acknowledges that Volunteer will not be compensated for any time spent volunteering or performing the Volunteer Activities, nor will Volunteer be entitled to any employment or other benefits, including without limitation, employment insurance benefits upon the termination of this agreement or as a result of this service.</p>

<h6>3. Indemnity</h6>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Volunteer shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Iridescent Learning, its directors, officers, employees, and agents against any and all losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, claims, actual damages, judgments, and costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from any claim against Iridescent Learning, which relate to or arise out of any acts or omissions of Volunteer taken or not taken within the scope of this Agreement.</p>

<h6>4. Liability Release</h6>

<p>Volunteer and his or her assignees, heirs, guardians, and legal representatives, will not sue or otherwise make any claim against Iridescent Learning or any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents for injury, damage or other loss resulting from any acts, however caused, by any of its directors, officers, employees or agents as a result of or relating to the Volunteer Activities or Volunteer’s service as a volunteer, other than any such acts caused by or resulting from the willful misconduct of Iridescent Learning or its directors, officers, employees, or agents.
