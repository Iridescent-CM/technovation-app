<h2>Welcome to the Technovation Girls community!</h2>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian(s),</p>

<p>Welcome to the Technovation Girls Community!</p>

<p>
  Thank you for supporting your daughter to participate in Technovation Girls, the technology entrepreneurship program
  and competition for
  <%= link_to "girls",
    "https://www.technovation.org/diversity-equity-inclusion-statement/",
    target: "_blank" %>.
  offered by
  <a href="https://www.technovation.org" target="_blank">Technovation</a>, a technology education non-profit.
</p>

<p>
  During the program, your child will learn the basics of coding and AI and create a tech project
  that solves a problem in her community. She will learn to be a technology entrepreneur! Technovation Girls is more
  than a coding program; it is an opportunity for your daughter to develop a variety of life and professional skills
  and challenge herself.
</p>

<p>
  It won’t always be easy, but she will be encouraged to persist when she meets adversity and obstacles. Completing
  the Technovation Girls curriculum is a huge accomplishment for every participant. When she is done, she will have
  completed the early stages of founding a real-life tech startup. Your child’s learning is at the center of all that
  we do. We share your commitment to your daughter’s success and have created a page to help you understand
  <a href="https://www.technovation.org/about/" target="_blank">more about the Technovation program</a>,
  and how you can help support your child’s participation. We take safety seriously and invite you to review our
  safety guidelines and other helpful resources

</p>

<p>
  Whether your child chooses to work in a team or on her own, we recommend that she be supported by a mentor (an educator,
  parent, or industry professional). In addition to completing Technovation’s online curriculum, your child will be
  expected to submit her project’s deliverables online. Your child can work and communicate with her mentor either
  online or at in-person sessions. Parents are always welcome to attend any sessions and monitor all communications
  - here is a

    sample communication plan
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  After your daughter’s team submits their idea, Technovation judges, who are technology and entrepreneurship
  professionals, will review the team’s entry and provide feedback on their work. After the judging process,
  if your daughter is selected as a program finalist, she and her team will be invited to attend the
  World Summit (in person or virtually) and present their pitch live to a panel of judges.
</p>

<p>
  We are delighted to help foster your daughter’s interest and development in technology and entrepreneurship
  and we are honored to work with students everywhere as they develop new skills and confidence.
</p>

  Warm Regards,<br>
  The Technovation Staff
