<p>Dear Parent/Guardian(s),</p>

<p>Welcome to the Technovation Girls Community!</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting your daughter to participate in Technovation Girls, the technology entrepreneurship program and competition for young women offered by <a href="https://www.technovation.org" target="_blank">Technovation</a>, a science and engineering non-profit.</p>

<p>During the program, your daughter will learn the basics of computer programming and create a mobile app that solves a problem in her community. She will learn to be a technology entrepreneur! Technovation Girls is more than a coding program; it is an opportunity for your daughter to develop a variety of life and professional skills and challenge herself.</p>

<p>It won’t always be easy, but she will be encouraged to persist when she meets adversity and obstacles. Completing the Technovation Girls curriculum is a huge accomplishment for every participant. When she is done, she will have completed the early stages of founding a real-life mobile app startup. Your daughter’s learning is at the center of all that we do. We share your commitment to your daughter’s success and have created a page to help you understand <a href="http://technovationchallenge.org/about/" target="_blank">more about the Technovation program</a>, and how you can help support your daughter’s participation. We take safety seriously and invite you to review our safety guidelines and other helpful resources <a href="https://iridescentlearning.org/safety/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Your daughter will work in a team supported by a mentor. Your daughter will complete our online curriculum and will be expected to submit all deliverables (inducing a pitch video) online. The team can work and communicate with their mentors either online or at in-person sessions. Parents are always welcome to attend any sessions and monitor all communications.</p>

<p>After your daughter’s team submits their idea, technology professionals will review the team’s entry and provide feedback (either online or in-person) on their work. Through the judging process, if your daughter is selected as a program finalist or winner, she and her team will be invited to attend the World Pitch Summit in the United States and present their pitch live to a panel of judges.</p>

<p>We are delighted to help foster your daughter’s interest and development in technology and entrepreneurship and honored to work with young women everywhere as they develop new skills and confidence.</p>

<p>If you have any questions at any time, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <%= mail_to ENV.fetch("HELP_EMAIL") %></p>

<p>Warm Regards,<br />
The Technovation Staff</p>

<p>Residents of the EU have certain rights afforded to them by the EU General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”).</p>
<p>i. Transfers out of the European Economic Area</p>
<p>We are based in Los Angeles, CA, and the Websites are hosted by third parties that are also based in the United States. Accordingly, when you provide Personal Information to us, it is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). To ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to your Personal Information when it is transferred outside of the EEA, we only transfer your Personal Information to the United States, and only with your consent as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we will only transfer your Personal Information to the United States on the condition that your rights are protected and that you have access to an effective legal remedy.</p>
<p>ii. Your EU legal rights</p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p>Request access to your Personal Information. We will send you a copy of your Personal Information that we have on record, which will enable you to check that we are using it within the lawful guidelines of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you, where the information is incorrect.</p>
<p>Request deletion of your Personal Information. As noted above, this may involve ending further participation in Technovation’s programs.</p>
<p>Object to us using your Personal Information. You may object on grounds that you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms, or on grounds that we are using your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your Personal Information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>Request restriction of our use of your Personal Information. You may make this request (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p>Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at Privacy@IridescentLearning.org. We may need to request additional information from you to help us confirm your identity. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. It may take us longer to respond to your request if your request is particularly complex or if you have made multiple requests. In that case, we will notify you and keep you updated on the status of your request.</p>
<p><em>B. Your California Privacy Rights</em></p>
<p>If you reside in California, you may request information about our disclosures of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us by e-mail at Privacy@IridescentLearning.org.</p>
<p>Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personally identifiable information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve the right not to respond to requests submitted other than as specified in the above paragraph.</p>
<p><em>C. Other Privacy Rights</em></p>
<p>The following provisions apply to all users of the Websites, regardless of location.</p>
<p>i. Data Retention</p>
<p>We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for; namely, to provide you with the benefits of participating in our programs. Periodically, and at least once every four years, we delete Personal Information of persons who no longer participate, retaining only enough Personal Information to ensure that persons who have opted out of Technovation communications are not opted back in to receive such communications.</p>
<p>ii. Data Breach Notification</p>
<p>In the event of any suspected data breach, we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. For EU data subjects, we shall notify the competent supervisory authority of any data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons within 72 hours of the breach, or else accompany our notification with reasons for the delay. This notification shall describe the nature of the Personal Information at risk, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the name and contact details of the data protection officer, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken to address the breach.
