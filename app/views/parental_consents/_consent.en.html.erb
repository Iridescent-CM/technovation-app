<p>Dear Parent/Guardian(s),</p>

<p>Welcome to the Technovation Community!</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting your daughter to participate in Technovation, the technology entrepreneurship program and competition for young women offered by Iridescent, a science and engineering non-profit.</p>

<p>During the program, your daughter will learn the basics of computer programming, coming up with a mobile app business idea, testing the idea, writing a business plan (senior division only), developing a prototype, and pitching to investors. She will learn to be a technology entrepreneur. Technovation is more than a coding program; it is an opportunity for your daughter to develop a variety of life and professional skills and challenge herself.</p>

<p>It won’t always be easy, but she will be encouraged to persist when she meets adversity and obstacles. Completing the Technovation curriculum is a huge accomplishment for every participant. When she is done, she will have completed the early stages of founding a real-life mobile app startup. Your daughter’s learning is at the center of all that we do. We share your commitment to your daughter’s success and have created a page to help you understand more about the Technovation program, and how you can help support your daughter’s participation.</p>

<p>Your daughter will work in a team supported by a mentor. Mentors can be found either on the Technovation platform or invited by your daughter or her team from their school or community. Your daughter will complete our online curriculum and will be expected to submit all deliverables online with her team by <%= Season.submission_deadline %>. (5:00 pm PST). Team can work with their mentors either online or at in-person sessions. Parents are welcome to attend session, if they want.</p>

<p>After your daughter’s team submits her submission, technology professionals will review the team’s entry and provide feedback (either online or in-person) on their work. Through the judging process, if your daughter is selected as a program finalist or winner, she and her team will be invited to attend the World Pitch Summit in the California, United States and present their pitch live to a panel of judges, in competition for part of the $50,000 in awards provided by Technovation.</p>

<p>We are delighted to help foster your daughter’s interest and development in technology and entrepreneurship and honored to work with young women everywhere as they develop new skills and confidence.</p>

<p>If you have any questions at any time, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <%= mail_to ENV.fetch("HELP_EMAIL") %></p>

<p>Warm Regards,</p>
<p>The Technovation Staff</p>
