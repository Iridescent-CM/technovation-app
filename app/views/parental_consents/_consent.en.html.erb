<h5>Dear Parent/Guardian(s),</h5>

<p>Thank you for supporting your daughter to participate in Technovation, the technology entrepreneurship program and competition for young women.</p>

<p>During the program, your daughter will learn the basics of computer programming, coming up with a mobile app business idea, testing the idea, writing a business plan, developing a prototype, and pitching to investors. She will learn to be a technology entrepreneur. It won’t always be easy, but she will be encouraged to persist when she meets difficulty.</p>

<p>Completing the Technovation curriculum is a huge accomplishment for every participant. When she is done, she will have completed the early stages of founding a true mobile app startup.</p>

<p>Your daughter’s learning is at the center of all that we do. We share your commitment to your daughter’s success and have created a page to help you understand <%= link_to "more about the Technovation program", "https://www.technovationchallenge.org/parents/", target: :_blank %>, and how you can help support your daughter’s participation.</p>

<p>Most Technovation participants find that their team is critical to their success in the program. A typical Technovation team is composed of up to five girls and at least one volunteer Technovation Mentor. Teams work together to complete the Technovation curriculum, which is accessible online at <%= link_to "technovationchallenge.org", "https://www.technovationchallenge.org/" %>. The submission deadline for the 2017 Technovation program is Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 5pm PT.</p>

<p>After your daughter’s team submits her Pitch Package, technology professionals will review the team’s entry and provide feedback on their work. If your daughter is selected as a program finalist or winner, she and her team will be invited to attend the World Pitch Summit in the San Francisco Bay Area and present their pitch live to a panel of judges, in competition for part of the $20,000 in awards provided by Technovation.</p>

<p>We are delighted to help foster your daughter’s interest and development in technology and entrepreneurship and honored to work with young women everywhere as they develop new skills and confidence.</p>

<p>If you have any questions at any time, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <%= mail_to ENV.fetch("HELP_EMAIL") %>.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,</br>
The Technovation Staff</p>
