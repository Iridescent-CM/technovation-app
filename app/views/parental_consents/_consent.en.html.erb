For example, we may run ads on social media that are tailored to you based on your relationship with Technovation, using information you have previously supplied to us, or if you have consented to those targeted ads. An example of a targeted ad may be information about a Technovation career development workshop appearing when you are logged into LinkedIn. You may object to this use of your data by opting out of “advertisement” cookies in the cookie settings at <%= link_to "https://www.technovation.org", "https://www.technovation.org" %> or emailing <%= mail_to "privacy@technovation.org" %>. Please note that targeted advertising does not include, for example, advertising to you in response to your request for information or feedback, advertisements based on activities within our own websites or online applications, or advertisements based on the context of your current search query, visit to a website, or online application, or processing Personal Information solely for measuring or reporting advertising performance, reach, or frequency </li>
  <li>Complying with a legal obligation where necessary, such as being compelled to share Personal Information by a law enforcement or government agency.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some Personal Information provided by participants registered at my.technovationchallenge.org may also be shared with the Chapter Ambassador for your region for the purpose of providing country-specific information on the program.

</p>

<h4>4. Consent for Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>
<p>
You may not always be required to provide us with the Personal Information that we are asking you for; any Personal Information that is required is clearly marked as mandatory. When you do not wish to share certain Personal Information with us, you may simply not provide it to us, or opt-out of the processing of your Personal Information when this option is offered to you. However, if you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, you may not be able to benefit from our program for which the provision of such Personal Information is necessary. We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information to meet certain legal requirements. In such cases, we will notify you in due time and advise you as to whether your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information).
</p>
<p><em>A. Consent by Adults (Aged 18 and over)</em></p>
<p>
By providing information to us in the manner described in Section 2 (“Our Privacy Policy”), you consent for us to use your Personal Information for the explicit purposes listed in Section 3 (“Purposes of Information Collection”) of the Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent at any time by any of the following methods:

</p>

<p><em>B. Parental Consent for Minors (Aged under 18)</em></p>

<p>
We require a parent or guardian to consent before a child under the age of 18 can participate in any Technovation programs or activities. Use of the Websites sometimes requires us to share your information with other users of the Websites and trained volunteers. Parental consent granted by the following methods includes consent for Technovation to collect and use the minor’s Personal Information as listed in Section 2 (“Our Privacy Policy”) for the explicit purposes listed in Section 3 (“Purposes of Information Collection”) of the Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Parents can provide consent by signing this form digitally, via email, or by postal mail for their minor children to provide personally identifiable information to us. The parental consent enables children under age 18 to participate in Technovation’s programs or activities. Parental Consent forms are emailed to parents when students register in Technovation Girls. Alternatively, consent forms can be downloaded for Technovation Families and Technovation Girls from the user’s dashboard. Upon receipt of the parental consent form, Technovation will unlock student accounts, and students will be eligible to participate in our programs.
</p>

<p>
Parents are highly encouraged to provide consent through the digital signature option. However, to provide consent by email or postal mail, parents should fill out the parental consent form, sign it, and send a picture or scan to Technovation at:

<p>Email: <%= mail_to ENV.fetch("HELP_EMAIL") %> with subject line: “Parental Consent for [Name of Child]”</p>

<p>Or send the original via mail:</p>
Technovation<br>
#1120<br>
700 El Camino Real Suite 120<br>
Menlo Park, CA 94025<br>

<p>
If we learn we have collected or received personal informationPersonal Information from a child under the age of 18 without parental consent, we will promptly delete the information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child without parental consent, please contact us via the methods listed under the “Contact Us” section at the end of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
In addition to any other applicable privacy laws described herein, we will collect, process, and use any Personal Information concerning a known child in accordance with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq. (“COPPA”).
</p>

<h4>5. Your Privacy-Related Rights</h4>
<p>
The protection of your Personal Information is an essential part of our activities. In order to provide you with a personalized experience, we will apply the data protection laws of your country and/or region of residence. This approach will also be consistent with consumer laws of the country and/or region of your habitual residence, and will therefore allow us to better meet your expectations regarding the protection of your Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
If you are a resident of any of the countries and/or regions identified below, please make sure that you refer to the specific information applicable to your jurisdiction.
</p>

<p><em>A. Your EU Privacy Rights</em></p>
<p>Residents of the EU have certain rights afforded to them by the EU General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”).</p>

<p>i. Transfers out of the European Economic Area</p>

<p>We are based in Menlo Park, CA, and the Websites are hosted by third parties that are also based in the United States. Accordingly, when you provide Personal Information to us, it is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). To ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to your Personal Information when it is transferred outside of the EEA, we only transfer your Personal Information to the United States, and only with your consent as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Additionally, we will only transfer your Personal Information to the United States on the condition that your rights are protected and that you have access to an effective legal remedy.
</p>

<p>ii. Your EU legal rights</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Request access to your Personal Information. We will send you a copy of your Personal Information that we have on record, which will enable you to check that we are using it within the lawful guidelines of the Privacy Policy. For data security purposes, you will be required to provide some information to verify your identity prior to receiving the copy of your Personal Information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you, where the information is incorrect.
  </li>
  <li>
    Request deletion of your Personal Information. As noted above, this may involve ending further participation in Technovation’s programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Object to us using your Personal Information. You may object on grounds that you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms, or on grounds that we are using your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your Personal Information which overrides your rights and freedoms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Request restriction of our use of your Personal Information. You may make this request (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <%= mail_to "privacy@technovation.org" %>. We may need to request additional information from you to help us confirm your identity. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. It may take us longer to respond to your request if your request is particularly complex or if you have made multiple requests. In that case, we will notify you and keep you updated on the status of your request.
</p>

<p><em>B. Your California Privacy Rights</em></p>

<p>
If you reside in California, you may request information about our disclosures of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us by email at <%= mail_to "privacy@technovation.org" %>.
</p>

<p>
Within forty-five days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personally identifiable information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than twice per calendar year. We reserve the right not to respond to requests submitted other than as specified in the above paragraph.
</p>

<p>
Registered minor users of the Websites in California may remove, or request removal of, any content that they post to the Websites or applications, subject to certain exceptions. In order to request that user-supplied content be removed, please contact <%= mail_to "privacy@technovation.org" %>. Note that removing, or requesting removal of, content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content from the Websites or applications.
</p>

<p><em>C. Other Privacy Rights</em></p>

<p>The following provisions apply to all users of the Websites, regardless of location.</p>

<p>i. Data Retention</p>
<p>
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for (namely, to provide you with the benefits of participating in our programs) or to comply with relevant legal, tax, and/or accounting requirements in the pertinent jurisdiction. Periodically, and at least once every four years, we delete Personal Information of persons who no longer participate, retaining only enough Personal Information to ensure that persons who have opted out of Technovation communications are not opted back in to receive such communications.
</p>

<p>ii. Data Breach Notification</p>
<p>
In the event of any data breach, we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. For EU data subjects, we shall notify the competent supervisory authority of any data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons within 72 hours of the breach, or else accompany our notification with reasons for the delay. This notification shall describe the nature of the Personal Information at risk, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the name and contact details of the data protection officer, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken to address the breach. We will also notify you without undue delay of any data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms.
</p>

<p>iii. Updates to the Privacy Policy</p>
<p>
Technovation may amend the Privacy Policy at any time, as necessary to comply with evolving international data privacy standards and regulations. Please check the Privacy Policy page (<%= link_to "https://www.technovation.org/privacy-policy/", "https://www.technovation.org/privacy-policy/" %>) periodically for changes. We will post a notice on this website if and when this policy changes to alert visitors that a new policy is in place. We will also revise the “Change Log” posted at the top of this Policy to reflect the date of the most recent update. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the privacy policy and applicable laws in place at the time the information was collected. To the extent permitted by applicable law, your continued use of the Websites indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h4>6. Security</h4>
<p>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of all Personal Information, including that of child users, we have put in place physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to protect the Personal Information we collect online. No data transmission over the Internet, however, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, Technovation cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of personally identifiable information you provide to us.
</p>

<h4>7. School Privacy</h4>
<p>
In some circumstances, we may permit a school to register students to our service for the purpose of providing educational services. Because Technovation provides the Websites to schools to benefit and enhance the school’s curriculum, Technovation relies on the school to obtain and provide appropriate consent, if needed, to collect Personal Information of students.
</p>

<h4>8. Third-Party Links</h4>
<p>
The Websites currently interact with the following third-party services that may have access to the Personal Information provided by the user as part of creating an account on the Websites. We use these third-parties to provide services on our behalf, assist us in providing new features, benefits, or service enhancements; enhance targeted advertising based on your browsing activities, interests and relevant geographical location; apply market research to generate audience insights; and develop and improve programs and products.
</p>

<p>
Technovation is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services although we try to provide the minimal Personal Information necessary to use them. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites or services, so make sure to review the applicable third-party data policies:

<h4>12. Liability Release</h4>
<p>
The Program Participant understands and agrees that participation in Technovation is entirely voluntary and is entered into with full knowledge of the risks involved. The Program Participant agrees to accept and assume any and all risks of unforeseeable nature, including, without limitation, risks of personal injury or financial loss. Technovation will not be responsible for any unforeseeable injuries, whether involving physical injury, property loss or other damages claimed to occur in connection with any activity, program or event sponsored by Technovation. THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT HEREBY RELEASES, WAIVES, DISCHARGES AND COVENANTS NOT TO SUE TECHNOVATION, ITS EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, RELATED ENTITIES, AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, “RELEASEES”)  from any and all liability arising out of or relating to the participation in Technovation sponsored programs, activities and events, including any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorney fees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, including without limitation resulting from involvement in this activity whether caused by any negligent act or omission of the releasees or otherwise. THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS the releasees from all liability, claims, demands, causes of action, charges, expenses, and attorney fees resulting from involvement in this activity whether caused by any negligent act or omission of the releasees or otherwise. THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT HEREBY ASSUMES FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND RISK OF BODILY INJURY, DEATH OR PROPERTY DAMAGE while participating in the activity or using any Technovation facilities and equipment whether caused by any negligent act or omission of releasees or otherwise. The undersigned expressly agrees that the foregoing release and waiver, indemnity agreement and assumption of risk are intended to be as broad and inclusive as permitted by California law. In any lawsuit arising from or relating to this Agreement, the fact-finder may not award any incidental, indirect, consequential, lost profits, punitive, exemplary, non-economic, or emotional distress damages. The Program Participant expressly waives the provisions of California Civil Code section 1542, which provides as follows: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
