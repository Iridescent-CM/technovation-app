        If you are looking for a participant in your Chapter that is not appearing on your participant page,
        please search the
        <%= link_to '"Unaffiliated"', chapter_ambassador_unaffiliated_participants_path %>
        tab. The "Find a Missing Participant" feature will be removed soon;
        all unassigned participants in your country will be on the Unaffiliated tab.
