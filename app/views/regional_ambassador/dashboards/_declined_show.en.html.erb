<p>We're sorry, but it looks like you donâ€™t fully meet the requirements to become a Regional Ambassador.</p>

<p>There are many other ways to get involved with Technovation. We hope you will consider supporting Technovation in one of the ways listed below.</p>

<p><%= link_to "Become a Mentor", mentor_signup_url %></p>
<p>Guide a team of up to 5 girls through the Technovation curriculum. Coding and mobile app development experience is not required. The most important thing is to be a consistent and supportive role model for your team.</p>

<p>Provide positive and constructive feedback to teams based on the judging rubric, so that they can continue to develop their ideas and take their app submissions to the next level.</p>
