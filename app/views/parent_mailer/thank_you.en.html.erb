          <%= link_to "Technovation Girls", @technovation_url %>
          is a free technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 10-18
          that offers girls around the world the opportunity to learn
          the skills they need to emerge as tech entrepreneurs and leaders.
          Every year we invite girls to identify a problem in their community,
          and then challenge them to solve it.

          Girls work in teams to build both a mobile app and a business plan to
          launch that app, supported by mentors and guided by our curriculum.
          In April, teams submit their app, pitch, and business plan online,
          and some teams participate in a Regional Pitch Event.

            <li>
              <strong>Share your experience:</strong>

              Through Technovation, girls are expected to learn how to work as a
              team, collaborate on a project, and divide work fairly.
              Share your experience and advice for managing disagreements,
              addressing frustration, and communicating clearly.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Share your network:</strong>

              Do you know someone who has a really interesting job? Would they
              be willing to give a tour and brief overview of their work to your
              daughter and her team? Can you introduce your daughter and her team
              to professionals who might have advice for them as they work on part
              of their project?
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Encourage others to sign up:</strong>

              Do you have friends with daughters who might be interested?
              Or colleagues who might want to mentor a team (locally or remotely)?
              Invite them to learn more about Technovation and join the movement.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Stay informed:</strong>

              Sign up to receive our
              <%= link_to "parent newsletter", @newsletter_url %>,
