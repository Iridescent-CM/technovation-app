          <strong>About Technovation Girls</strong><br /><br />

          <%= link_to "Technovation Girls", @technovation_url %>
          is a free technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 8-18
          that offers girls around the world the opportunity to learn
          the skills they need to become problem solvers and leaders who 
          aren't afraid to learn new technologies.
          Every year we invite girls to identify a problem in their community,
          and then challenge and support them to solve it.

          Girls work in teams to build a mobile app or an AI project along with
          a business plan to bring the solution to the world. Girls are supported
          by mentors and guided by our curriculum.
          In April, teams submit their app or AI prototype, pitch, and other
          <%= link_to "submission materials", "https://technovationchallenge.org/submission-guidelines/" %>

              <strong>Share your experience:</strong>

              Through Technovation Girls, girls undertake a big project and 
              are expected to learn how to work as a team, collaborate on 
              a project, and divide work fairly. Share your experience and 
              advice for staying motivated through tough times, managing disagreements,
              addressing frustration, and communicating clearly.

              <strong>Share your network:</strong>

              Do you know someone who has a really interesting job? Would they
              be willing to give a brief overview of their work to your
              daughter and her team? Can you introduce your daughter and her team
              to professionals who might have advice for them as they work on part
              of their project?
