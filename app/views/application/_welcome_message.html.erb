    <p>
      We're excited to begin registration for our
      <%= Season.current.year %>
      Technovation season.
      Through this website, you will be able to sign up as a student, as a mentor,
      as a judge, or you can apply to become a regional ambassador.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you complete your profile, you can create a team, join another team, 
      invite students to join your team and also find virtual or in-person mentors
      in your area.

      You will also have access to the full Technovation curriculum, which will
      walk you through identifying a problem in your community, developing a
      mobile app, and building a business plan and pitch.
    </p>
