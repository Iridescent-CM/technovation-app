      We're excited to begin registration for our <%= Season.current.year %> Technovation season.

      After you complete your profile, you can create a team, join another team, invite students to join your team and also find virtual or in-person mentors in your area.
      You will also have access to the full Technovation curriculum, which will walk you through identifying a problem in your community, developing a mobile app, and building a business plan and pitch.
