          Technovation is an online program, and we want to make sure you know
          how to be safe online. Technovation will connect you with an adult
          mentor to support you as you develop your app. We trust our mentors.
          They have been pre-approved to support your team, but we still recommend
          that you take a few minutes to

          <strong>Rules and Honor Code:</strong>

          When you registered, you signed an honor code promising that the work
          you submit at the end of the program will be completed entirely by
          students, and that you are not submitting previously created work as
          part of your submission. This is also a rule of the competition.
          If you are found breaking this rule, your team will not be eligible
          to participate.
