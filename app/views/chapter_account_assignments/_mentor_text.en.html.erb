  Technovation chapters connect students with mentors, classes, and other supports as they complete the Technovation Girls program.

  If you would like to connect with a chapter, please select one from the list and we will share your contact info with the Chapter Ambassador.

  If you are open to mentoring students from anywhere in the world, please keep the "remote mentor" option selected and students around the world will be able to match with you. You can be a remote mentor while also being associated with a chapter.
