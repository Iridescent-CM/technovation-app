  Technovation Girls’ mission is to educate and empower young women
  to make a difference in their community using technology. In order to
  maintain a fair, safe, fun, and friendly competition for all involved,
  it is important that all participants agree to support young women in
  realizing this mission.
</p>

<p>
  You promise that all elements of your team’s <%= Season.current.year %>
  Technovation Girls submission were created solely by the students
  on your <%= Season.current.year %> Technovation team. Exceptions: 
  Returning participants are allowed to submit the same project idea 
  (developed during past seasons) - only if updates and improvements 
  have been made to the project during the current season.
</p>

<p>
  Students may receive assistance from mentors in learning new skills
  and finding resources, but mentors will not create, design, develop or
  write any aspect of the team’s submission deliverables.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, you or your team members will cite any sources you use, such 
  as tutorials, code libraries, code templates, datasets, and more.
