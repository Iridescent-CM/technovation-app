<p>
  Technovation Girls’ mission is to educate and empower 
  <%= link_to "young women", "https://www.technovation.org/diversity-equity-inclusion-statement/" %>
  to make a difference in their community using technology. In order to
  maintain a fair, safe, fun, and friendly competition for all involved,
  it is important that all participants agree to support young women in
  realizing this mission.
</p>

<p>
  You promise that all elements of your team’s <%= Season.current.year %>
  Technovation Girls submission were created solely by the students
  on your <%= Season.current.year %> Technovation team. Exceptions: 
  Returning participants are allowed to submit the same project idea 
  (developed during past seasons) only if the team has made updates 
  and improvements to the project during the current season.
</p>

<p>
  Students and mentors promise that they may have received assistance 
  from mentors in learning new skills and finding resources, but that 
  mentors did not create, design, develop or write any aspect of the 
  team’s submission deliverables.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, you or your team members agree to cite any sources you use, 
  such as tutorials, code libraries, code templates, datasets, and more 
  in the Learning Journey section of your submission.
