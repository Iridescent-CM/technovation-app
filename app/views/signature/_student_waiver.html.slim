  #### Dear Parents,

  Thank you for supporting your daughter to participate in Technovation, the technology entrepreneurship program and competition for young women.

  During the program, your daughter will learn the basics of computer programming, coming up with a mobile app business idea, testing the idea, writing a business plan, developing a prototype, and pitching to investors. She will learn to be a technology entrepreneur. It won’t always be easy, but she will be encouraged to persist when she meets difficulty.

  Completing the Technovation curriculum is a huge accomplishment for every participant. When she is done, she will have completed the early stages of founding a true mobile app startup.

  Most Technovation participants find that their team is critical to their success in the program. A typical Technovation team is composed of up to five girls, one volunteer Technovation Teacher, and one volunteer Technovation Mentor. Teams work together to complete the Technovation curriculum, which is accessible online at <http://technovationchallenge.org>. The submission deadline for the 2015 program is April 16th.

  After your daughter’s team submits her Pitch Package, technology professionals will review the team’s entry and provide feedback on their work. If your daughter is selected as a program finalist or winner, she and her team will be invited to attend the World Pitch event in the San Francisco Bay Area and present their pitch to prospective investors, in competition for part of the $20,000 in awards provided by Technovation.

  If you have any questions at any time, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <info@technovationchallenge.org>

  We are delighted to help foster your daughter’s interest and development in technology entrepreneurship and honored to work with young women everywhere as they grow their skills and confidence in technology and entrepreneurship.

  Warm Regards,

  Samantha Quist, Program Director
  Technovation
