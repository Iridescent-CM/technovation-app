  # The Processor is a standalone thread which:
  #
  # 1. fetches a job from Redis
  # 2. executes the job
  #   a. instantiate the Worker
  #   b. run the middleware chain
  #   c. call #perform
  #
  # A Processor can exit due to shutdown (processor_stopped)
  # or due to an error during job execution (processor_died)
  #
  # If an error occurs in the job execution, the
  # Processor calls the Manager to create a new one
  # to replace itself and exits.
