Version 0.3.0 - NOV.05.2012 - first version maintained by Peter Boling

* ClassWithHasFlags.set_#{flag_name}_sql # Returns the sql string for setting a flag for use in customized SQL
* ClassWithHasFlags.unset_#{flag_name}_sql # Returns the sql string for unsetting a flag for use in customized SQL
* ClassWithHasFlags.flag_columns # Returns the column_names used by FlagShihTzu as bit fields
* has_flags :strict => true # DuplicateFlagColumnException raised when a single DB column is declared as a flag column twice
